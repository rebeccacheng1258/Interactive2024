<h1>FROM BEING TO BECOMING</h1><br>
<h2>NUSHU AND SENTIMENTS IN A <br>CHINESE RURAL COMMUNITY</h2>
<br><br><br>
<h3>ABSTRACT</h3><br>
<p>
In this article, I explore the sentiments of kelian
(the miserable) that were accentuated in the
Chinese literature written in a script called nüshu
(female writing), which men could not read. Not
known to the outside world until the 1980s when
it was becoming extinct, nüshu was used for
centuries by peasant women in Jiangyong County,
Hunan Province, southern China. By examining
the textual, contextual, and performative
meanings of nüshu, I argue that sentiment is not
only part of human phenomenological experience,
but it also partakes in the way lives are defined,
articulated, reflected, and reconfigured. In
Jiangyong, sentiment was not merely a carrier of
nüshu women's worldview or an embodiment of
their existence as isolated and powerless beings
in a Confucian - androcentric agrarian community.
More importantly, it functioned as an energy flow
that prompted inspiration and engagement - which
these women needed to offset and transform
their isolation and powerlessness. This research
fills the void in understandings of peasant women's
expressive traditions in rural China in the early
20th century. It also lends insights into the
dialectical relations between human existence
(perspective and lived reality, being and becoming,
subjectivity and collectivity) and forms of
emotional expression. [sentiment, women,

<br><br><br>
<h2>How many beautiful women die sad and with misfortune;
How many of them shed tears throughout their lives ....<br>
We read nüshu
Not for official titles, not for fame,
But because we suffer.
We need niishu to lament our grievances and sentiments of bitterness ....<br>
Each writing and each phrase is filled with blood, nothing but blood.
When reading it,<br>
No one would not say, <br><br>
"It is truly miserable."</h2><br><br><br>
<P>
This verse was written by a village woman named Cizhu, who was
born in the early 20th century in Jiangyong County, Hunan
Province, southern China. As were the majority of peasant women
born in Chinese androcentric communities prior to the Liberation
of 1949, Cizhu was demed access to educatmn m which she could
learn official Chinese hanzi characters. Accordingly, she was nearly denied
the opportunity to be an active subject who wrote history. But, unlike
women in other Chinese rural areas, she was able to learn a script
developed by Jiangyong women who had preceded her, a script that men
could not read, called nüshu, or "female writing." For centuries, Jiangyong
women had been using nüshu to write in verse form the sisterhood letters,
biographic laments, wedding literature, prayers, folk stories, and other
narratives that documented their experiences and articulated their feelings.
In contrast to the femal e- specific nüshu - a term that refers both to the
script and to the literature written in it - Jiangyong women called official
hanzi characters nanshu, or "men's writing."<br><br>

Its female specificity has brought nüshu a reputation as women's
"secret" writing, but this is erroneous. In rural Jiangyong, nüshu was widely
visible and audible - nüshu was used by women of almost every age and on
various occasions; in fact, it was meant to be heard and shared through
chanting or singing. But men paid scant attention to nüshu sung performance
or nüshu content, let alone made any effort to become literate in the nüshu characters. In other words, although nüshu may
have empowered women by allowing them to express
themselves and exchange viewpoints with one another, it
is also evidence of women's failure to gain understanding or
recognition from men. This distinctive female script was,
thus, never acknowledged in imperial historical archives
such as gazetteers, and it was unknown to the outside world
until the 1980s, just as it was becoming extinct.<br><br>

The predominant reason for nilshu's lack of recognition
involves the interplay between Confucian gender
ideology and moral concerns. According to Chinese historiography,
women's "inner quarters" (Ebrey 1993)-the
domain in which women's social and sentimental worlds
were constructed-were defined as inappropriate for public
gaze unless they exemplified or jeopardized social
mores. A woman's life, for example, was recorded in
Jiangyong's historical gazetteers mainly when it demonstrated
the act of martyrdom or the virtue of chastity.
Nüshu, by contrast, was not specifically intended for the
articulation of moral values but was a genre for su kelian,
or "lamenting the miserable," as powerfully exemplified in
the verse cited above. In contrast to moral concerns, in
Chinese historiography such sentiments were either considered
unimportant and, therefore, were overlooked or
were seen as disruptive and, thus, were discouragedunless
they were mediated by proper rites or aesthetic
transformation, as revealed in the Confucian expression,
"Issued forth from emotions, but regulated by propriety"
(fahu qing zhihu li). Because the significance of sentimentanchored
and female - specific nilshu literature was always
dismissed by Chinese male literati and historians, the
"feminist messages" (Radner 1993) that were encoded in
centuries - old nüshu have remained concealed and obscured.
This article aims to reveal the undecoded messages
in nilshu, specifically, the sentiments of kelian.</P>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<h3>CONCEPT-<br>UALIZATIONS</h3><br>
<p>
Built on the anthropology of emotion that rebuts post-enlightenment
Cartesian dualism (i.e., reason - emotion,
mind - body, public - private), sentiment in this article is
conceptualized mainly as a culturally constructed sensory
perception through which a person receives and responds
to the world, in terms of socialization or identity fabrication,
and is influenced or exercises influence (e.g., Besnier
1995; Brenneis 1987; Fung 1999; Grima 1992; Lutz and
Abu-Lughod 1990; Potter 1988).4 Such a position is based
on the recognition of the dual character of emotion as
"embodied thoughts" (Rosaldo 1984), "an index of social
relationship" (Lutz 1988), or "a way of interpreting and
understanding the world" (Maschio 1998) and as an
energy flow that prompts the inspiration as well as the
engagement (see Abu-Lughod 1990; Reddy 1997) that
make transformation possible and interactions intelligible. Acknowledging this dual character, I treat emotion or sentiment not as the final destination where voices settle
but as an open field in which lives are articulated, given
meaning, and recontextualized as a site at which one
goes from being to becoming.<br><br>

In the following analysis, I start with a nüshu story
known as the "Tiger Incident," using it as a referential axis
from which to unfold the first of the aforementioned
dimensions of emotion - that is, how the genre of su
kelian, or "lamenting the miserable," gave voice to Jiangyong
peasant women's existence as vulnerable beings.5
Of the hundreds of nüshu stories I have collected during
field trips to Jiangyong since 1992, the "Tiger Incident" is
one of only two thus far identified that were also documented
in local gazetteers written by male elites. This
allows for a comparison of two narrations of the same
event, not for the purpose of reducing narrative differences
in terms of gender-for social class is also involved-but to
provide an intertextual framework from which one can
elicit "hidden transcripts" (Scott 1990) encoded in the
sentimental genre of nushu.<br><br>

According to Mikhail Bakhtin (1986), no text has ever
simply existed by itself, but one text is always generated in
relation to another. In other words, every text is an index
referring to another spatial or temporal domain of messages
(Duranti 1993), an intersection or dialogue among
several writings (Kristeva 1980), or the product of an
ongoing process of producing and receiving discourses
(Briggs and Bauman 1995). This concept of "intertextuality"
frees one from the confines of the literary format of
text and opens up analytical visions to include multiple
texts, context (personal experience, historical-cultural
bearing, and generic implication), performance (reading,
storytelling, singing, and commenting), and participants
(reader, audience, and researcher). It is, thus, a useful
perspective that helps one to track diverse paths along
which meanings associated with a text multiply, detour,
traverse, settle, or aim toward some end -a n approach
that is of special benefit when the author is unidentifiable,
as is the case for the vast majority of nüshu stories. In line
with this thinking, in considering the second dimension of
emotion - how it penetrates and configures women's lifeworlds - 
my approach is context and performance sensitive.
Moreover, I textually examine nüshu with reference to
local women's other distinctive expressive tradition, namely,
the oral nüge, or "female song," which includes bridal
laments, folk songs, and narratives. My responsibility as
an ethnographer is to identify and weave together the
potentially intertextually linked threads into a "web" (cf.
Geertz 1973) acknowledging nilshu as a su kelian genre
that allowed for the recontextualization of Jiangyong worn -
en's existence.<br><br>

Through the dual examination of sentiments expressed
in nüshu and nüge, I endeavor to lend insight into twobodies of literature. First, I encourage reflection on the way in which Chinese women, although sharing a similar social
structure, are diverse in geography and social class. Contemporary
sinological research on female literature is
largely concentrated on the urban centers, such as in the
Lower Yangzi, or on members of the educated class, such
as courtesans or literati, especially of the Ming - Qing era
(1368-1911; e.g., Fong 2001; Ko 1994; Mann 1997; Widmer
and Chang 1997). Nüshu - nüge, however, provide access
to knowledge in an arena that remains underexploredthat
is, rural women's expressive cultures in southern
inland China between the late 19th century and the Liberation
of 1949.<br><br>

Furthermore, because the construction and circulation
of knowledge cannot be separated from the means by
which knowledge is expressed, I call attention to the
dialectical relations between human existence and forms
of emotional expression. Specifically, I argue that sentiment
is not merely a carrier or marker of thought, power,
or relationship but is also a flow of energy that acts on and
engages the protagonists. Sentiment is not just part of
human phenomenological experience but also plays an
active role in the way lives are felt, articulated, and
reflected. Sentiment in this sense is not reducible to any
simple matter of discourse construction or voice articulation,
and it cannot be replaced by any other expressive
medium. From the researcher's perspective, this irreducible
and irreplaceable quality suggests that sentiment
enjoys a distinctive "excess of seeing" (Bakhtin 1990)that
is, it possesses a unique horizon that exceeds the
limits of one's viewing zone or analytical angle when
positioned from a sentiment - insensitized perspective. 8 In
this light, sentiment should not be discredited, trivialized,
or mistaken as noise - a propensity of both Confucian and
Western epistemologies - but should be utilized as a lens
through which the otherwise unperceived existence of
certain people may become perceivable.</p>

<h3>PERFORMANCE, LINGUISTICS, AND SOCIAL SETTINGS OF NUSHU</h3><br>
<p>

Nüshu was discovered in 1982 by a Chinese scholar named
Gong Zhebing while studying the Yao ethnic group in
southern China. Gong learned about the female - specific
writing system from a male informant, whose deceased
aunt was a niishu user in Jiangyong County, located near
the borders of Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong areas.
Investigating further, Gong discovered that younger women
knew little of this script and that older women had
stopped using it during the Cultural Revolution (1966- 76),
when niishu was condemned as "witches' writing." With
the aid of a retired local official named Zhou Shuoyi, who
did a preliminary investigation of niishu in the 1950s while
compiling Jiangyong's post-Liberation cultural history,Gong (1991) not only found a piece of cloth on which was written a nüshu biographic lament, but he also located
some women who could actually write in this script.9 Soon
after, the female-specific writing was introduced to the
outside world. <br><br>

My first fieldwork trip to Jiangyong occurred ten years
later (1992-93). 10 By that time, approximately five hundred
pieces of niishu literature had been collected, transliterated,
and published (Gong 1991; Xie 1991c; Zhao et al.
1992). Nevertheless, by the time of my arrival, all known
niishu writers except one woman in her eighties had died
(several others have since been identified).<br><br>

The lack of active practitioners presented a serious
challenge to my attempts to collect a diverse body of data,
but nüshu's unique performance helped me to overcome
this constraint to some degree. Although primarily considered
a written system, nüshu required performance in
the form of singing or chanting, making it interchangeable
with local women's oral tradition, namely, nüge. Indeed,
singing was the first step toward becoming nüshu literate,
because users had to match sounds with the written
graphs; after mastering the ability to read nüshu texts, it
was easier to learn how to write the script. Before
becoming fully proficient as a writer, a woman would
approach and transmit written nüshu as oral nüge. After
becoming proficient, she could transcribe nüge into nüshu
text. As a result, a hierarchy existed among nüshu women - 
there were those who could read and write, others
who could only read, and still others who were limited to
singing and listening to nüshu stories. My primary informants
fell into the final category; some had previously been
completely nüshu literate but had lost their writing skills
after the Cultural Revolution. Even so, these women, most
of whom were over 50 years old, had observed the transmission
and performance of nüshu in their families and
had participated in the nüge tradition during girlhood,
making them valuable resources in the reconstruction of
textual and contextual meanings of nüshu - nüge. Because
nüshu - nüge had fallen out of fashion as a result of social
change brought about by the Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) since the 1950s, my informants' accounts primarily
reflect the viewpoints, performative contexts, and social
settings of women born in rural Jiangyong from the late
19th to the first half of the 20th century.<br><br>

The concern with contextuality and performance not
only expands the ethnographic basis of my research, but
it also helps fill a void in existing nüshu scholarship. In
addition to textual analysis, most contemporary niishuniige
studies have centered on issues regarding nüshu's
historical origins and linguistic features, particularly its
relation to official Chinese hanzi characters. Researchers
now commonly agree that nüshu differs from hanzi in
two major ways, one graphic and one linguistic. First,
whereas hanzi characters are square, nüshu characters are rhomboid shaped, using arcs, oblique lines, and slender strokes.  Second, whereas hanzi ideographs represent
meanings, nüshu characters may represent sounds
as well as meanings - in the nüshu system, words that
sound the same in the native dialect can be written the
same way. Its phonetic characteristic made nüshu much
simpler to learn than hanzi, because it could be followed
easily during sung performance. Therefore, no formal
classes were required; women could learn nüshu - nüge
while doing needlework together or while participating in
the singing sessions that were part of wedding ceremonies.
At the same time, nüshu's dialect basis had encapsulated
its circulation within a relatively small, if not
hidden, confine, adding a mysterious undertone to this
female - specific script.<br><br>

This mysterious tone is reinforced by the still unknown
origins of nüshu. According to one local legend,
nüshu was invented between C.E. 1086 and 1100 by a
woman named Hu Yuxiu, who was sent to the Imperial
Palace to become a concubine of the emperor - not for her
beauty but because of her reputed literary talent. A nüshu
allegedly written by Hu describes her palace life:<br><br><br>

I have lived in the Palace for seven years.<br>
Over seven years,<br>
Only three nights have I accompanied my majesty.<br>
Otherwise, I do nothing ....<br>
When will such a life be ended, and<br>
When will I die from distress? ...<br>
My dear family, please keep this in mind:<br>
If you have any daughter as beautiful as a flower,<br>
You should never send her to the Palace.<br>
How bitter and miserable it is,<br>
I would rather be thrown into the Yangzi River.<br><br><br>

Lonely and distressed, Hu wanted to send messages
home, but her status as an emperor's concubine was a
barrier. According to the legend, she invented nüshu script
as a means of getting around the court guards and censors,
because the script only made sense when chanted in the
Jiangyong dialect.<br><br>

Hu's legend perfectly captures the spirit of nüshu as a
vehicle for expressing lamentation. But like many folktales,
this story cannot be confirmed, as no documents
have been found to verify it. The earliest historical account
of nüshu found to date was written in 1931-in it,
nüshu was described as "fly - head - like tiny scripts" that
"no man can read." 20 As for the original handwritten
niishu, most older copies were destroyed by Japanese
soldiers during World War II or by Red Guards during
the Cultural Revolution (Endo 1995, 1996); more recent
ones were burned or otherwise destroyed after the deaths
of their owners, because most families failed to see any
value in keeping them.<br><br>

Because of the lack of evidence, there is little agreement
among investigators as to when and why nüshu was
generated. Xie Zhimin (1991a, 1991b) has described
nüshu as a residue of an ancient script as old as jiaguwen
(bone and tortoiseshell inscriptions), created at least
1,000 years before the unification of the Chinese writing
system in 221 B.C.E. In contrast, Chen Qiguang (1995)
and Zhao Liming (1995) maintain that the nüshu script
was derived from Chinese kaishu calligraphy, making it
no more than 1,000 years old. And Gong (2001) argues
that nüshu was not invented until the Qing dynasty
(1644-1911). On the basis of my fieldwork, I can only
trace the use of nüshu back 150 years or so - many of the
elderly women I spoke with recalled the popularity of
niishu among their grandmothers' and great - grandmothers'
generations. A recently found coin made during
the Taiping Rebellion (1851-64) was stamped with
niishu-reading "women in the world are sisters in the
family" (tianxia funu jiemei yijia) - further confirming
the script's active use during the mid-19th century.<br><br>

Zhao (1995) contends that nüshu evolved from women's
weaving and embroidery traditions. (Nüshu were not
only written on papers, fans, cloth, and handkerchiefs, but
they were also woven into hand-knit belts.) But Chen
(1995) and Tang Gongwei (1995) deny its female origin
by suggesting that it may have been used initially as a
secret communication system for purposes of political
dissent, quite possibly by the Yao ethnic group. Yao are
linked to nüshu in that Jiangyong has long been considered
a major settlement area of this minority (Gong 1986;
Hu 1970). Examples of the Yao's strong cultural influences
in Jiangyong include belief in the panhu (giant gourd)
deity and the female customs of weaving belts, participating
in ritual sisterhood (or sworn sisterhood), and singing.
The practice of delayed patrilocal residence, known as
buluofujia - whereby a married woman does not move in
with her husband until she is about to deliver her first
baby - may also be Yao derived.<br><br>

Following the mass migration of Han Chinese into
the Hunan area from the north during the Tang - Song
period (618-1279), the original Yao inhabitants were
separated into sinicized groups living in upper Jiangyong
and unsinicized groups living in the mountains and in
lower Jiangyong (Wu 1991). This spatial distribution
reflects the economic geography of Jiangyong. Surrounded
by mountains about two thousand meters high,
Jiangyong was connected to the outside world during
imperial times mainly through two courier roads (Jianngyong
xianzhi 1995). One went from Jiangyong to Dao
County, in Hunan, linking upper Jiangyong, where the
Xiao Water of the Yangzi River flowed, to Han Chinese
cultural and political centers in the north. The other went
from Jiangyong to Gongcheng, in Guangxi, through which
lower Jiangyong, cut through by the Tao Water of the Pearl River, was integrated into the Yao - Miao - Zhuang
minority region. Nüshu was first discovered, and circulated
in, upper Jiangyong, where migratory Han and
sinicized Yao lived.<br><br>

Most Yao-associated customs have been sinicized,
that is, transformed by and subject to Confucian patriarchal
principles-especially gender ideologies. For example,
the Yao are renowned for singing shan'ge (mountain
songs), the major medium through which young people
flirt with the opposite sex or find partners. But in the
nüshu - nüge area of circulation, where arranged marriage
was the norm, women were not allowed to perform this
genre because it was thought to violate female decency.
Buluofujia (lit., not falling into the husband's family) is
another example of sinicization. The Yao buluofujia allows
a female to find her own lovers before cohabiting with her
husband, but within the nüshu - nüge community, such
pre- or extramarital affairs were never permitted. Indeed,
all of the nüshu - nüge women I met came from communities
marked by adherence to the Confucian patriarchal
complex - patrilineality, patrilocal village exogamy, and a
village - based agrarian economy. In this setting, women
were defined in terms of an "inner" or "domestic" persona,
as opposed to the "outer" or "public" persona
reserved for males. Specifically, prior to 1949, women
had no property rights beyond their dowries, which occasionally
included farmland. Except those born into gentry
families, women were usually illiterate in terms of standard
hanzi characters. In part because of the practice of
footbinding, only women from extremely poor families
worked in the fields. Concubinage was common, especially
when a first wife failed to bear a son within the first
few years of marriage.<br><br>

In Confucian - or Han - oriented upper Jiangyong,
nüshu and nüge were tightly integrated into local women's
major life events. Before marriage, young girls made sisterhood
pacts and wrote niishu letters to each other (Silber
1994). Brides performed nüge laments as their weddings
approached, and their peers or female relatives sometimes
wrote niishu wedding literature, called "sanzhaoshu"
(third-day-books), as bridal gifts (Liu 2000; Zhao 1995).
After marriage, women relied on nüshu and niige as
sources of personal strength whenever they felt vulnerable
and lacked male support. Those wanting offspring wrote
niishu prayers to fertility deities, and widows composed
biographic nüshu - nüge laments to assuage their frustration
and sadness and to evoke sympathy from the secular
world (Liu 2001).<br><br>

Married or single, some Jiangyong women may have
used nüshu to transmit folk stories originally written in
hanzi - many of which were too long to easily memorize
and recite (cf. Idema 1999; Liu and Hu 1994; McLaren
1996; Silber 1995). Others composed nüshu - nüge narratives
to comment on extraordinary events they had observed. One very popular narrative, for example, describes an 18-year-old girl who killed the three-year-old boy with
whom she was forced into marriage. In the story the girl
complains, "Washing his feet and putting him to bed,
only to be awakened by his cries for breast-feeding at
midnight. 'I am your wife, not your mother!' " (Zhao et al.
1992:512). The tale that is the focus of the following
analysis, the "Tiger Incident," is another example of
nüshu narrative.
