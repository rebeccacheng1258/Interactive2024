<h1>ON FIRE <br>IN WEIBO:</h1><br>
<h2>FEMINIST ONLINE ACTIVISM IN CHINA</h2>
<br><br><br>

<p>

The year 2012 witnessed a new wave of feminism in mainland China with feminist performance art in the
street and feminist online activism. Through examining
three significant online activities in China since 2012, this
paper explores how feminists have made the social
media, especially Weibo, their new stage for feminist
activities that are different from the traditional ones and
that are able to provoke heated discussions among both
the public and the mainstream media. Through Weibo
and the other social media, grass-roots feminists have
opened up a new bottom-up mode of activism different
from the dominant top-down paradigm prevalent since
the 1980s.<br><br>

A new chapter of the feminist movement in China has begun in the past two years.The year 2012 witnessed
exciting changes in feminist activities, some of which
included the emergence of feminist street performance art
against gender inequality and sexism,and the controversial
feminist online activism in Weibo.<br><br>

With "feminist phobia" prevalent in post-Mao China,feminists have long been stigmatised and their discussions on gender issues mostly ignored. However, since 2012, a new kind of
feminist action—street performance art—conducted mainly
by the "grass-roots (caogen)" young feminist activists, have
attracted attention not only from the mass media and the gen
eral public, but also from the government. The first perform
ance art of this kind was "Occupying Men's Room" in February
2012 in Guangzhou, which aimed to fight for more women's
public toilets and also marked the beginning of the new femi
nist movement in China. Another two landmarks in feminist
performance art were: "Shaving Bold Head Action" to fight
against the sexism in college enrolment, also in February 2012
in Guangzhou, and "I Can Be Slutty, But You Cannot Harass
Me" action in Shanghai to protest against the sexist statement
by the municipal subway authorities in June 2012.<br><br>

It is significant that the veteran feminists from feminist
non-governmental organisations (ngo) or intellectual circles
have been active in providing such young feminist activists
with all kinds of support, such as offering funding, training on
how to raise feminist consciousness and on how to conduct
feminist street activities to attract the attention of the mass
media and the public, as well as making the theoretical argu
ments to further the young feminist activists' actions, etc. The
two important feminist ngos to support the young feminist
activists are the Media Monitor for Women Network in Beijing
and the New Media Women Network in Guangzhou.
<br><br>
uch cooperation among the feminists is also demonstrated
in their use of new media. The young feminist activists have
made the best use of social media, mainly Weibo, to share real
time information about their every activity so as to attract
more attention and to provoke discussions on gender issues
among the general public. The veteran feminists have backed
up the young feminist activists by writing comprehensive
reports on their actions with clearer and more systematic
feminist ideas and arguments in their influential online
journals, such as Women's Voice affiliated to the Media
Monitor for Women Network. In the last two years, with their
use of the new media, the feminists in China have been able
to make feminist activities and arguments more visible to
the pubic.<br><br>

It is under such circumstances that the new media, especially
Weibo, is becoming a new stage for feminist activism. With over
500 million users-almost the same size as the population of
Chinese netizens,  Weibo has become the most important new
social medium in China. Although the mass media and many
levels of public participation are strictly restricted by the government
under the state policy of "Harmonious Society," in reality,
the internet, especially a platform like Weibo, has offered a
comparatively freer, non-hierarchical and participatory space
for the general public, especially for the marginalised and the
stigmatised, to conduct online activities to fight for their rights.
Although Weibo is still censored by the government in China, it
is believed that such censorship is not very effective after all, for
its fast dissemination and large population of users have made
the messages spread through it quite irrepressible. As a result,
feminists have tried to transform Weibo into their new stage to
conduct online activities that are even more "outrageous" than
their controversial street performance art in the offline world.
The three landmark feminist online activities that have stirred
up heated discussions in the mass media and among the general
public are "Nudity against Domestic Violence (ov)"-feminists
posting their naked pictures for petition on anti-ov;" Ye Haiyan's
protest against a headmaster's molesting of schoolgirls and
Ai Xiaoming's nudity in support of Ye;the celebration of the
10th anniversary of The VaginaM onologuesp erformed in China
and "the Vagina Event'' with about 17 female college students
from the Beijing Foreign Studies University (BFsu) posting pictures
online quoting what their vaginas say.<br><br>

Although feminist online activism is blossoming in Weibo in
China, little scholarly attention has been paid to such a topic.
Although there is an increasing scepticism about online activism
as "slacktivism" (Morozov 2009), especially in the Western
world, it is worth asking to what extent feminists in China are
empowered by the new media. What kind of changes have
they made through such online activism for themselves as well
as for the feminist movement in China?<br><br>

In this paper, I explore these questions through my investigation
of the emerging feminist online activism in China since
2012 via Weibo. In doing so, I will draw the picture of feminism
in the making in China in the age of new media, showing
how feminists enact their agency and creativity and carry out
a new feminist politics via this internet platform. Online activism
in this paper refers to "the contentious activities associated
with the use of the internet and other new communication
technologies" (Yang 2009: 3), which can be classified as
"internet-enhanced" or "internet-based" (Vegh 2003: 71).<br><br>

The three online activities I mentioned above are considered
as milestones in the emerging feminist online activism,
and they have been included among the Top 10 Events on Gender
in China in 2012 and 2013, respectively, 14 attracting great
attention from both the general public and the mass media. I
have collected my data mainly from two Weibo accounts-The
Women'sV oice1,5 affiliatedt o Media Monitor for WomenN etwork,
and the Women's Awakening,16 affiliated to New Media Women Network. My observation lasted from February 2012
to the end of 2013. The data I have collected include the reports,
comments, discussions, debates and the detailed special
reports on the above three online activities from the Weibo
accounts and from a few other related internet resources.<br><br>

I have begun my analysis by reviewing the development of
feminist activism in China since the establishment of the People's
Republic of China (PRC) in 1949 so as to lay out the historical
background for my arguments about the changes the
feminists have made via Weibo. Exploring the features of feminist
online activism, I note that they include: the importance of
the body, the diverging and converging relationship between
online activities and offline activities, and its decentred nature.
Through such activism, I argue, the feminists could: enact their
agency and creativity in making a new genre of body politics by
transforming their own bodies into a battlefield against gender
and political repression; form a diversified feminist network;
and establish an open coalition with the lesbian, gay, bisexual
and transgender (LGBT)c ommunity, all of which could not be
addressed in the traditional feminist activism.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>
<h3>FEMINIST ACTIVISM IN MAO AND POST-MAO ERAS</h3><br>
<p>
Since the establishment of the PRC, gender equality and protecting
women have been part of state policy. The All-China
Women's Federation (ACWFw) as formed in April 1949 under
the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (ccP) to
implement such a policy named "women's work" (junv
gongzuo). As a result, gender equality was guaranteed by the
state through ensuring an equal ratio between men and
women in the state-owned enterprises and state institutions.
In addition, with the ACWF's "women's work" and the
government's propaganda about the idea of the "iron
maiden"-the proud image of the masculinised woman
working as hard as her male counterparts, women were
socialised into gender-equal belief and they strived for both
personal and social equality. However, such implementation
of "gel\der equality" in Mao's era has been questioned by many
scholars. On the one hand, the "women's work" in that period
had to conform to or be subordinated to the statist project
(Wang 2005: 523). On the other, the female subjectivity is
actually eliminated in masculinising women, since masculinity
then becomes the universal standard (Li 1999: 270). Even
Elisabeth Croll (1978), who feels otherwise optimistic about
the changes in women in such a period, points out that women
were forced to shoulder the invisible double burden-work in
the public and in the family, with the domestic housework not
acknowledged, and that women were discouraged from
discussing such dilemmas.<br><br>

In Mao's era, "women's work" was conducted within a socialist
state discourse, aiming to improve women's productivity and to
seek for political rights for the mass of the women. However, since
the open up and reform policy in the 1980s, with the growth of
the market economy, women in China began to reshape their
gender awareness and female subjectivity from production to
consumption, from political rights to personal success (Li 1999;
Zhang 2000). It was also in the 1980s that "feminism" as aWestern concept was introduced to China via the increasing
number of translated works on the development of feminism in
the Western societies by the officialsf rom ACWFa nd the scholars
in the universities, both of which belonged to state institutions.
Although feminism was rejected as a Western bourgeois discourse
and feminists were stigmatised as "freaks," heated discussions on
indigenising feminism in China also took place in the intellectual
circles. One key argument was about the development of
corporeal feminism: to reinvent women's body; which was erased
in Mao era, in the real life and in the culture of the post-Mao era
(Ll 1999; Dai 2001). The 1990s witnessed an upsurge of ''body
writing" among the female writers challenging the taboos on
women's bodies and celebrating women's self-awareness and
sexual desires, which were mostly marked in Lln Bai's and Chan
Ran's novels. 17 In this period, although the feminist activism was
blossoming in different aspects, it was mainly conducted in a topdown
manner. Such corporeal feminism was confined to
intellectual discussions and to literature.<br><br>

A new wave of feminist activism began in mainland China
with the introduction of the concept of the NGO after the
Fourth United Nations (UN) Conference on Women (FUNCW)
held in Beijing in 1995. While the ACWFh as been questioned as
a univocal representation of Chinese women and as putting
state ideology before feminism (Judd 2002; Wang 2005), the
emerging feminist NGOs have been considered as posing a
challenge to the ACWF, with diversified women's voices and
new spaces for feminist activities beyond the statist project
(Hsiung et al 2001; Milwertz 2002; Wesoky 2002). However,
the feminist NGOs gradually leaned towards cooperation with
the ACWFa nd the state with their new orientation of "demanding
state and public recognition of women's legitimate rights in
all spheres of life, as well as enhancing state and public awareness
of the effects of gender hierarchy" (Wang 2010: 102).<br><br>

As a result, feminists in such NGOs have developed an entangled
triangular relationship with the ACWF and the state and
they have gained their legitimacy and autonomy within such a
relationship accordingly. Their feminist activities are conducted
in a wider range, whereas they are also constrained to the
politically correct issues which means conformity to the state
ideology which is still patriarchal (Wang 2010:117). As a result,
the feminist activism within such a triangular relationship is still
conducted in a top-down manner, with the grass-roots feminists
rarely seen, not to mention their activities. In addition, sensitive
topics such as nudity and lesbian sexuality have long been
ignored in such feminist activism as "political incorrect."<br><br>

Another kind of feminist activism in the same period in
China since the 1990s is the establishment of research centres/
institutions on women/gender studies and the increasing
courses on feminism and gender in universities are all over
China. The professors of such institutions and courses are
often members of or have close bonding with the feminist
NGos. As a result, it is commonly seen that feminist activities
are conducted by the college girls, such as feminist saloons,
16 Days of Activism against ov, etc. However, most of such
feminist activities have been conducted by a small group of
college girls within the campus only, not open to the public.<br><br>

So although there have been changes in feminist activism
from seeking political rights in the Mao era to pursuing personal
success in the post-Mao era, such activism rarely challenges
the government. While feminist activism in the Mao era
tried to mobilise the mass of women, its effects beyond the settings
related to the state institutions, such as in private business
and the domestic field, were questionable. While feminist activism
in the post-Mao era seems to switch its focus to the opposite
direction, it has also been criticised by a number of feminists,
such as Ai Xiaoming, as "seldom cooperating with grassroots
women and other parties, and confining its main frontier to the
• campus, the academia and the intellectual circle rather than
being confronted with the general public and society.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>
<h3>FEMINIST ACTIVISM: ONLINE AND OFFLINE</h3><br>
<p>
The emergence ·of grass-roots feminists is attributed to the development
of internet in mainland China. While the grass-roots
feminists have few resources, they are able to establish their online
organisations with much less cost and at the· same time
avoid government surveillance. Also, the cyberspace is the most
accessible arena for public engagement and the grass-roots feminists
could mobilise more women to participate via the internet.<br><br>

In the past few years, the new media, especially Weibo, has
become more and more important for the feminists, because of
its immediate information sharing and wide range of interaction.
As a matter of fact, the young feminist activists have
been labelled by the mass media as feminists 2.0 and the new
wave of feminist activism led by them as feminist activism
2.0.19 These young activists are especially good at making the
best use of the social media, especially Weibo for self-promotion
of their feminist activities and for interaction with more
people in discussing feminist issues.<br><br>

The emergence of such grass-roots feminists, especially the
young feminist activists, has stimulated new cooperation between
them and the veteran NGO feminists. But in fact, such
bonding originated from the earlier feminist activism-the
gender courses set up by the female professors, who are themselves
veteran feminists or closely associated with them. Most
of the young feminist activists have been enlightened by those
gender courses and gradually identified themselves as feminists.
While the veteran feminists offer their help at the back
end, such as offering funding and training, the young feminist
activists focus on conducting the feminist actions in public,
both online and offline.<br><br>

Scholarly attention has been paid to the online activism in
China as a contention to the government (Yang 2006; 2009).
Studies on Weibo focus on exploring to what extent it reaches
the new public sphere for the grass-roots activists (Jiang and
Yan 2010; Guan 2013). The current research on the internet
from a gendered perspective is mainly concerned about women's
everyday use of it (Khun 2008), such as the re-establishment
of female subjectivity online, the phenomenon of online dating,
etc. However, very few of the above studies have paid attention
to the relationship between feminist activities and the
new media, especially Weibo, not to mention the changes the
feminists have made via such online activism.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>
<h3>NUDITIY AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE</h3><br>
<p>
On 7 November 2012, feminists launched a petition calling for
10,000 signatures to facilitate legislation against DV in China,
and signatures were collected both online and offline. On
13 November, when the heat of such a petition was dying out,
one of the famous young feminist activists, Xiao Meili, posted a
picture of herself with the slogan "Shameful to commit domestic
violence; Pride in ~aving flat chest" inscribed on her naked chest
so as to re-attract people's attention to the petition. On top of
the picture, ';<\nti-DvL aw" was written in red, followed by "Legislation"
in the middle and "Collecting Signature for Petition" at
the bottom. Such a picture was crazily retweeted in Weibo and•
quite a few young feminist activists, lesbian activists and even
gay activists followed Xiao and posted similar pictures in Weibo
to support such an action. It is interesting that Xiao mixed up
the messages with nudity, flat chest and anti-ov. It is even more
interesting that although the participants in the online activism
basically followed Xiao's pattern of the photo highlighting the
anti-Dv theme, most of them added messages about all kinds of
taboos regarding the female body and queer identity. For instance,
in another photo, Li Maizi, another famous young feminist
activist, showed her armpit hair with words reading, "Love
for armpit hair; DV is a crime." As for male participants, the gay
activist Billy wore a bra in a very girly posture with the slogan, "I
can be sissy; you cannot hit me." Another photo from the bisexual
lesbian activist Yan in Hangzhou also read, "I love men. I love
women. I love whoever I love. It is not the reason for DV."<br><br>

This was the first feminist online activism in China highlighting
feminists' own nudity and connecting such "controversial"
nudity with the political correct issue-anti-Dv. As a result, it
attracted the great attention from the mass media and provoked
heated discussions among the public, mainly on the confusing
relationship between the nudity and DV. Yet such online
activism also gained support from the veteran feminists with
their more detailed explanations for such relationships and
their debates with the angry netizens. There was a whole series
of special reports organised by Women'sV oicei ssued in Weibo.2 1
Although this online activity was meant to enhance the petition
for the legislation of anti-Dv, it seemed to open up a new space
for these young feminist activists to make a corporeal connection
with all kinds of feminist issues, which is different from the
corporeal feminism discussed above, which was either within
intellectual arguments or embodied in the literary writing.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>
<h3>PROTESTS AGAINST SEXUAL HARASSMENT</h3><br>
<p>
In May 2013, a primary school headmaster in Wanning took
four school girls to a hotel and molested them. Although the
sensational case aroused public attention, the investigation did
not go smoothly. The parents were condemned by a section of
the media for their daughters' inappropriate lifestyles and they
were also threatened by some local officers who pressurised
them to withdraw the lawsuits.<br><br>

It was under such circumstances that Ye Haiyan, who is a
sex worker and a famous grass-roots feminist in China, went
to the school in Wanning to protest and posted in Weibo her
picture showing her standing in front of the school, holding a sign: "Headmaster, ask me to go to hotel with you, let go of the
children. Contact number 12338." The number is actually the
public hotline for women's protection. Her sarcastic yet creative
protest was supported by a large number of netizens, who
in a short time flooded Weibo with protests basically following
Ye's pattern. This activism engaged a much wider range of
netizens than usual, including police officers and straight men.<br><br>

Not long after that, Ye was arrested for her online activism.
22 The young feminist activists immediately initiated an
online petition in Weibo to ask for the netizens' signatures to
press the police to release Ye, and the famous feminist and
scholar Ai Xiaoming showed her support by conducting her
own online activism.<br><br>

On 30 May 2013, Ai Xiaoming posted her nude picture in her
blog, with a scissor in her hand symbolising castration, and the
words on her bare chest reading: ''.Askm e to go to hotel with
you; let go of Ye Haiyan." The picture was retweeted repeatedly
on Weibo the moment it was posted online. A heated discussion
on Ai's action was stirred up immediately, with some admiring
her bravery and some questioning her morality. Such an online
activity also attracted attention from the mainstream online
media. In June, Ai's letter explaining her action was issued in
the online journal Co-China with the title "Who Is Afraid of the
Female Body''23 and the article was shared quickly in Weibo.
Later on, the Lady.163.com published a long and exclusive interview
with Ai giving more details of her arguments of female's
nudity as resistance in the authoritarian context.<br><br>

Ai's nudity-based activism surprisingly responded to the
earlier "Nudity against ov" beyond her main purpose. Yet her
picture and her statements gave the best articulation between
nudity, bodily autonomy and resistance against gender and
political repression, which had not yet clearly been explained
in the earlier online activity. As Ai stated in Co-China, female
bodies have been disciplined to be docile, depoliticised to be
sexual objects, whereas she aimed to re-politicise the female
body as a weapon against the male gaze and state surveillance
and to regain the female's bodily autonomy by demonstrating
her "ugly" and "abnormal" female body as a fat, old one with
the saggy breasts that have fed her child.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>
<h3>THE VAGAINA EVENT</h3><br>
<p>
The year 2013 ushered in the 10th anniversary of The Vagina
Monologues performed in China. Since Ai Xiaoming's first Chinese
version of The Vagina Monologues in 2003, the play has
been localised and revised in many different versions and performed
all over China during the past 10 years. 26 Young people,
many of who are among the young feminist activists and
also members of the LGBTc ommunities, have established their
own troupes and rewritten the play with Chinese women's
special experiences. The most significant changes in the three
famous indigenised versions in 2013 in Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangzhou are the newly added scenes concerning LGBT issues.
As a result, such a feminist play in China has extended
beyond the gender binary to challenge heteronormativity.<br><br>

Among the positive and celebratory atmosphere, in November
2013, 17 female students in BFsu posted their pictures holding signs saying "My vagina says-,"such as for example, "My
vagina says: 'virginity is bullshit."' Those students were actually
quoting from the VaginaM onologuesw hich they had enacted in
their universities, and such action had aimed to promote their
play in the social media. However, such online photos immediately
exploded in Weibo. It became one of the heated topics in
the Weibo Topic Ranking List and the number of tweets exceeded
50,000 the moment the picture was posted. It provoked
much more controversial debate both online and offline and
attracted much wider attention from the mass media than the
earlier online activities; however, most of the comments were
condemnations of those college girls' sluttiness and immorality.<br><br>

The young feminists again initiated the online activism right
away to call for netizens' support in copying those girls' actionposting
their pictures with signs saying: My Vagina says .... On
the other hand, when some veteran feminists posted articles online
to explain the relationships between vagina, women's bodily
and sexual autonomy, the gender inequality and the patriarchal
discourse in China in confiscating and objectifying women's
body, it provoked two other "surprising" discussions: the women's
rights versus the human rights; and the conflicts between
the grass-roots and intellectual feminists.27 On 2 December 2013, a
conference was held by the Media Monitor for Women Network,
inviting the three famous troupes of the VaginaM onologuesa nd
active feminists to share their experiences and to discuss "the
Vagina Event." Interestingly, many of the participants of the
conference were also involved in the first two online activities.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>
<h3>FEATURES OF FEMINIST ONINE ACTIVISM</h3><br>
<p>
Three features of the feminist online activism in Weibo arethe
significant role of the body, the divergence and convergence
between online activities and the offline ones, and its
decentred nature. I argue that the online feminists could enact
their agency and creativity in establishing a new genre of body
politics in visualising their own nudity as resistance against
the gender and political repression, which could not be realised
in the real life because of the state's surveillance. They
could build a diversified feminist network beyond the triangular
relationship mentioned above; and establish an open coalition
with the LGBT community, that has been avoided in the
"traditional feminist activism" as "political incorrectness."</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>
<h3>IF THE BODY COULD SPEAK</h3><br>
<p>
Nudity is nothing new in the art forms in China or in feminist
protests in the world, such as FEMEN's nudity demonstrations in
Russia since 2008. However, in the earlier feminist activism in
the Mao and post-Mao eras, the connection of the feminists'
own nudity and feminist advocacy was not imaginable.
Through the new media, especially Weibo, feminists are able to
enact a new kind of agency to facilitate a corporeal feminism
through re-politicising their own bodies in subverting both the
gender inequality embodied in all kinds of taboos on women's
bodies and the political repression against feminist action.<br><br>

In an interview, Xiao Meili, 28 who started "Nudity against nv,"
confessed that her first idea of posting her nudity in Weibo was
based on her bet with others whether such nudity would be censored by the state or not. Since the censorship was not exercised,
such a testing proved that Weibo could offer a new space
for feminists' radical activities, which are not allowed in the offline
life under the state surveillance. Xiao's connection of nudity,
flat chest and nv was creative in opening up discussion on all kinds .
of possible violence against women's bodies within a patriarchal
discourse even beyond nv. As a feminist commented online,<br><br>

The logic behind ov and discrimination against women's flat chest is
the same: men's control over women's bodies. The difference is: the
former is explicit, whereas the latter is implicit, with men's violence
internalised and naturalised in the process of women's formation of
subjectivity. Women's body is a battleground. The bodily autonomy is
not only shown in anti-ov, but also in pride of the flat chest.<br><br>

Through such online activism in Weibo, on the one hand,
feminists aimed to break the taboos regarding female bodies
and to provoke unprecedented debates on women's bodily autonomy.
On the other hand, the young feminist activists felt
that they had achieved a sort of self-liberation through exposing
their flawed bodies. As Xiao stated, "I have completely accepted
my body after the online activity."<br><br>

For feminists, "the women's body as battleground" not only
applies to the fight against gender inequality, but also to the
critique of political repression. As Ai Xiaoming said in supporting
Ye Haiyan through her own nude protest, Ye as a feminist,
held a peaceful protest against the molestation of schoolgirls on
her own, yet still got arrested; therefore, her own body and the
internet were the only weapons available to her to fight against
such injustice in the non-democratic and feminist-unfriendly
context. She emphasised that it was only the demonstration of
her nudity that was powerful enough to show her anger and to
fight back against the state's patriarchal violence.<br><br>

Feminists made their bodies speak loud and clear against disciplining
women's bodies. Feminists also demonstrated their
creativity in such online activism in making the messages diversified.
Take the first case for example, when the theme focused
on anti-nv, feminists also came up with different taboos on female
bodies that they tried to attack, such as Xiao Meili's flat
chest and Li Maizi's armpit hair. In the second case, while Ai
adopted Ye's pattern of online activism to support her and to
protest, she also took the new form of nudity to show her anger
and held a pair of scissors to symbolise castrating the headmaster
as well as the state patriarchal power. In such online activism,
feminists demonstrated both their agency and creativity in
establishing a new genre of body politics, in which they transformed
the female bodies from playground into battleground.
Through such visualisation of their nudity with their creative
fighting manifestos inscribed on their chests, they succeeded in
making their bodies speak, reclaiming their bodily autonomy,
and re-politicising their bodies for resistance.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>
<h3>ONLINE AND OFFLINE ACTIVISM</h3><br>
<p>
While the above online activities aimed to facilitate the offline
ones, such as in the cases of the "Nudity against nv" with its
purpose for the petition of collecting signatures for legislation
of anti-nv and Ai Xiaoming's nudity to call for Ye's release,
they seemed to diverge from the original themes, drawing the public's attention to a separate issue, and therefore, opening
up another unexpected battlefield for discussions on female's
bodily autonomy. In addition, the two online activities seemed
to be connected in a retrospective manner. Although the
"Nudity against ov" petition was considered a failure and it
seemed to disappear from online space, it was responded to
later by Ai's nudity. Ai's and other feminists' discussions on
"the Vagina Event" extended the previous discussions on the
earlier two online activities from women's bodily autonomy to
their sexual autonomy. As a result, the three online activities
converged in a non-linear relationship. They had seemed
independent from each other and aimed for different feminist
issues from their own beginning, yet all ending up in
responding to and reinforcing each other on women's bodily
and sexual autonomy. Feminist online activism seemed
like ripples, extending the dialogues from one online activity
to the other and all together forming the subversion
against the hegemonic discourse on women's body and
sexualities.<br><br>

In addition, through such online activism, a new diversified
feminist network for feminist activism, different from the triangular
relationship among the state, the ACWF and the feminist
NGos, is being built and expanded as well, between the
young feminist activists in different places all over China,
between young feminist activists and the veteran feminists,
between the intellectual feminists and the grass-roots feminists.
For example, in all the three online activities, while the
online activity was initiated by one feminist in Weibo, it was
immediately followed and supported by the other young feminist
activists in other geographical locations in China. In the
first and third cases, while the young feminist activists initiated
the controversial online activities, the veteran feminists
retweeted their activities, wrote articles and debated with netizens
to back up the young feminist activists. In the second
case, when Ye, a grass-roots feminist was arrested, Ai and
many other feminists tried to help her in different ways. In
addition, feminists' later online activities also responded to
the earlier ones, with all kinds of feminists involved. Such as in
the second case, while Ai's nudity formed the echo to the first
one, a loose support network has been formed between Ai, Ye
Haiyan, the veteran feminists who supported Ye and the
grassroots young feminist activists in an indirect and non-linear
relationship. In the third case, while most of the participants
were also involved in the first two instances of activism, again
a loose but diversified network involved different feminists,
grass-roots feminists, young feminist activists, veteran
feminists, feminist professors, and feminist experts of all kinds.</p>

<h3>DECENTERED ONLINE ACTIVISM-COALITIONAL POLITICS</h3><br>
<p>
"Decentred" here is in two senses: for the participants and
for the themes of the online activities. The online activism
was actually leaderless and non-programmatic in all three
online activities, and therefore, feminists were able to mobilise
any concerned citizens without any fixed identity. In this
way, an open alliance was formed and deformed based on the
temporarily shared political concerns between feminists and the non-feminist participants with different identities. In addition,
the original themes were also diversified in many aspects,
especially from the gender dimension to the queer
identities and desires. Therefore, it seemed that a definite telos
was not set up among those feminist online activities and
an open assemblage was allowed for all kinds of convergence
and divergence. For instance, in the first case, while its theme
was about anti-ov, it took the form of nudity, which redirected
the discussions onto women's bodily autonomy. Some of the
participants also decentered the theme and reoriented it to
the LGBT identities, such as the gay man and the bisexual
activist mentioned above. In the last case, the discussions
on feminists' bodily and sexual autonomy were also made
diverse by the debates on the women's rights versus the human
rights and the conflicts of classes within feminists. With its
"decentred" characteristic, in each online activity, the feminists
were able to establish open coalitions in mobilising the
participants with different identities to join in their activities
and sharing a common political agenda.<br><br>

It -seems, therefore, that coalitional politics in China has
been made possible in feminist online activism, especially the
coalition between feminists and LGBT activists, mainly the
lesbian activists. In the first case, more than half of the nude
pictures with slogans were posted by the LGBTm embers, most
of them lesbians. In the third case of the Chinese versions of
The VaginaM onologuesm, any of the members in the three
troupes were gay and lesbian activists and their experiences
were transcribed into the play and performed by the LGBTa ctivists.
Such a coalitional politics is part of the new wave of
feminist activism, different from the traditional feminist activism
in post-Mao era, in which LGBTis sues and lesbian activists
were excluded.<br><br>

The new feminist movement in China, including the emerging
feminist online activism, is an exciting and vital picture in
which a new feminist politics, decentred, yet more diversified
and subversive, is being made. However, there are still a lot of
problems in such a new feminist activism. The conflict of different
classes within feminists is still a thorny one. The
discourse on feminism in China is still made by the elites, because
although the young feminist activists are at the grassroots
in a general sense, most of them are college students or
graduates, still connected to the university and the intellectuals.
The patriarchal discourse is still powerful and the misogynist
culture is still prevalent in both real life and the virtual
world in Weibo and in the internet. In the end, Weibo might
not be a utopian public sphere. However, a movement is about
the moment. It is definitely an exciting moment worth-recording,
a moment that shows feminists' creativity and bravery for
conducting online activism via Weibo and opening up a new
chapter of the feminist movement in China. However we see it,
there is no doubt that feminist online activism is on fire in
Weibo in China.</p>
